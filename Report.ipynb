    "Reinforcement learning is a fundamental type of machine learning that stands along with supervised and unsupervised learning methods. We use supervised learning when for example we have some labeled dataset, and we would like to predict labels for unseen data (like cancer detection based on MRI images or stock price prediction based on previous time series data). When we would like to make sense of dataset that does not contain any labels, we use unsupervised learning methods, for example, we want to detect fraudulent transactions (anomaly detection) or cluster users by their preferences. In contrast with supervised and unsupervised types of learning, reinforcement learning does not apply to the dataset directly but tries to make sense of an environment by making actions and receiving rewards.\n",

The solution to this problem is to use the **epsilon-greedy policy**.\n",

    "## DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN stands for Deep Q-Network, it is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is showing its efficiency for many RL setups. The first significant improvement to DQN was introduced by London-based company DeepMind when their team introduced several enhancements to DQN and showed the validity of the agent by playing many Atari games at superhuman performance level. They published the research paper titled \"[Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236)\" in Nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me introduce the loss function for DQN:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_i(w)=E_{(s,a,r,s')}[\\underset{Q_{target}}{\\underbrace{(r+\\gamma \\; \\underset{a'}{max} \\; \\hat{Q}(s',a';w^-_i)}}-Q(s,a;w_i))^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepMind uses a neural network as function approximator for mapping state-to-action based on Q values. Because of nonlinearity introduced by using neural networks, the whole DQN algorithm becomes unstable and could diverge from solution. The instability has several causes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. strong correlation between sequences of observations (solution is to use Experience replay)\n",
    "2. correlation between $Q$ and $Q_{target}$ network (solution is to use Fixed $Q_{target}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experience replay\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of experience replay comes from biology, where human brain receives information and learns something during the day, but in the night time the bain grows neural connections and reflect on the experience that was gathered during the daytime. Concerning the RL agent the process looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[EX] initialize experience replay buffer\n",
    "[S] get the initial state\n",
    "while current time < final time\n",
    "    [A]     <- agents selects action \n",
    "    [S',R'] <- get responce from env\n",
    "    [EX]    <- [S, A, R', S'] append buffer\n",
    "    [S]     <- [S'] update old state value\n",
    "    if [EX] buffer is full, then\n",
    "        learn randomly from [EX]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the agent collects tuples $<S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}>$ while interacting with the environment and after reaching some threshold, starts to learn the collected mapping. To break to correlation, uniformly sample experiences from the buffer during learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Q target\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla w = \\alpha \\; \\underset{TD \\; error}{\\underbrace{\\underset{Q_{target}}{\\underbrace{(r(s,a) + \\gamma \\; \\underset{a}{max} \\; Q(s',a';w^-_i)}} - \\underset{Q_{value}}{\\underbrace{Q(s, a, w))}}}} \\; \\underset{Gradient \\; Q_{value}}{\\underbrace{\\nabla_w Q(s,a,w)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "TD error is the same term that is used to compute the loss. Loss measures how far predicted value from the expected solution. While learning oscillations occurs because $Q_{target}$ and $Q$ share the same weights, it like trying to shot an arrow to the target, but the target is always moving. It was shown that the use of two identical by architecture, but different by weights, the neural network would solve the oscillation problem. Coming back to arrow analogy, we will force the target to remain still for some time. In terms of algorithm, $Q_{target}$ (aka \"old\") and $Q$ (aka \"new\") networks update weights of the old with new network once every $T$ iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Double DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "Double DQN was first introduced by [Hado van Hasselt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) where he showed that state of the art deep Q-learning algorithm is prone to overestimate action values for some Atari 2600 domain. Double DQN is the specific adaptation, which reduces the observed overestimation and improves performance on several games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at how we select next action in the DQN algorithm. By definition, the algorithm states that it sould take the action, which yields maximum Q value. We know that quality of Q value is higher when the agent explores an environment better by visiting all the states and taking all the actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla w = \\alpha \\; {{\\underset{Q_{target}}{\\underbrace{(r(s,a) + \\gamma \\; \\underset{a}{max} \\; Q(s',a';w^-_i)}} - \\underset{Q_{value}}{\\underbrace{Q(s, a, w))}}}} \\; \\underset{Gradient \\; Q_{value}}{\\underbrace{\\nabla_w Q(s,a,w)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the begging the agent does not have a reasonable estimate for the Q-value table, it is noisy. Hence the agent cannot reliably use the Q value without bias. The solution is to use Double DQN, which decouples selection of the best action and Q value estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{target} = r(s,a) + \\gamma \\; \\underset{Estimated \\; by \\; Q_{target}}{\\underbrace{ Q(s', \\underset{Q_{value} \\; \\text{network}}{\\underbrace{\\underset{a}{argmax} \\; Q(s',a)}})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $indx = [\\underset{a}{argmax} \\; Q(s',a)]$; Find the action number that gives the highest reward for the next state. Use current $Q_{value}$ network for this step.\n",
    "2. $Q(s', indx)$; Use $Q_{target}$ network to get the Q value for the state-action pair.\n",
